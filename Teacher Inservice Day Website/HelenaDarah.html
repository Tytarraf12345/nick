                <h2>Title: Informal Assessments</h2>
            <p>Description: I attended a HSTW conference in Columbus, OH and learned a vast amount of quick, easy and extremely beneficial informal assessments that I've been utilizing in my Essentials and my Co-Taught class on a daily basis. One of them is called \"whip around\", the other is the Quizzizz game to test for class accuracy and to measure growth and a few more. My students enjoy these mini assessments and benefit from them. They are inclusive as no student is singled out and it can assess comprehension and mastery for the whole classroom.  I'd like to talk about quick and easy formal and informal assessments which can be used every day in any classroom setting. I frequently teach lessons in the co-taught setting (about 3 times a week) and have 3 of my own Essentials Classes and the assessments work in all of them. \n\nThe first is \"whip around and pass\" which I learned at the HSTW Seminar in Columbus. The second I learned from a colleague (George France) called \"Quizzizz\" which is great for goal-setting per lesson and can pin-point areas where students still struggle. \"Caption it\" is great for the Social Studies and Science courses for students to make a caption to a picture posted based on what they learned in the lesson (also good for inference skills). Finally, strategic multiple choice, which has the teacher create multiple choice questions which may \"trick\" the student. The objective is to have the students explain why the other options are incorrect and how they made the mistake. \n\nI am also SIMS trained and have great mnemonic device strategies for studying, vocabulary strategies and reading comprehension strategies. So, if informal assessments are already covered by another teacher, I'd be happy to teach strategies for all students.</p>
